# arcade

An arcade-oriented physics engine for Haxe

This library is mostly a port of [Phaser v2 arcade physics](https://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/arcade-physics) modified to be framework agnostic.

⚠ This port is very recent, there is no Haxe specific documentation for now. That said, you can take a look at [Phaser v2 arcade physics](https://phaser.io/examples/v2/category/arcade-physics) examples to see what you can do, as they should work exactly the same for most cases.

### Credits

This library was ported and modified for Haxe by **Jérémy Faivre** from the existing work of:

* **Richard Davey <rich@photonstorm.com>**, author the original arcade physics library for Phaser v2
* **Timo Hausmann**, author of the initial [QuadTree implementation](https://github.com/timohausmann/quadtree-js), ported to Phaser then to Haxe.
